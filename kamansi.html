      <h2>1. Exploring the Internal Profile of Kamansi</h2>
      <p>Kamansi (Artocarpus camansi), also called breadnut, is a tropical fruit closely related to the breadfruit. It features a spiny green outer skin and starchy seeds inside. Unlike its cousin breadfruit, kamansi is valued more for its seeds than its flesh. The seeds are boiled, roasted, or cooked in dishes for their nutty, hearty taste.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="benefits">
      <h2>2. Dietary Benefits and Nutritional Values</h2>
      <p>Kamansi seeds are rich in protein, carbohydrates, and essential fatty acids. They provide an excellent plant-based energy source and are also good for digestive health because of their fiber content. Vitamins like thiamine, niacin, and minerals such as potassium are abundant in kamansi.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="culture">
      <h2>3. Cultural Significance</h2>
      <p>In the Philippines, kamansi has traditional uses both in cuisine and in rural life. It is often included in stews and coconut milk-based dishes. Historically, kamansi trees are grown near homes not only for their food but also for their strong wood and broad shade-providing canopy.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="economy">
      <h2>4. Economic Contributions</h2>
      <p>Though not a major commercial export, kamansi contributes to household food security and local markets. Farmers sell kamansi seeds and fruits during harvest season, while the trees themselves serve multiple purposes including timber and animal feed, enhancing rural livelihoods.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="sustainability">
      <h2>5. Sustainability and Conservation</h2>
      <p>Kamansi trees are hardy, low-maintenance, and climate-resilient. Their deep roots help stabilize soil, while their fruit and wood reduce the need for imported food and materials. Encouraging kamansi cultivation supports biodiversity and promotes sustainable agricultural practices in tropical regions.</p>
