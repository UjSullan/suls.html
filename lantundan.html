      <h2>1. Exploring the Internal Profile of Lantundan Banana</h2>
      <p>The Lantundan banana, also known as apple banana, is one of the most popular banana varieties in the Philippines. It is smaller than the typical Cavendish banana and has a slightly tangy, apple-like flavor. Its skin turns yellow with brown spots when ripe, while the flesh is sweet and creamy.</p>

      <p>Lantundan bananas are a great source of potassium, vitamin C, dietary fiber, and natural sugars, providing a quick source of energy. They also aid in digestion, help regulate blood pressure, and contribute to heart health due to their rich potassium content.</p>
