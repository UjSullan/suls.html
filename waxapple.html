      <h2>1. Exploring the Internal Profile of Wax Apple</h2>
      <p>Wax Apple, locally known as Makopa, is a bell-shaped tropical fruit with smooth, shiny skin that comes in shades of red, pink, or green. Its crisp and juicy flesh offers a mildly sweet flavor, often compared to a light apple or watermelon.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="benefits">
      <h2>2. Dietary Benefits and Nutritional Values</h2>
      <p>Wax Apples are low in calories and rich in water content, making them perfect for hydration. They also provide a small amount of fiber, vitamin C, and potassium, supporting digestive health, immunity, and electrolyte balance.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="culture">
      <h2>3. Cultural Significance</h2>
      <p>Makopa holds a place in Filipino childhood memories, as it often grows in home gardens and is shared among neighbors. It is sometimes used in salads, pickled treats, or enjoyed fresh as a refreshing snack during the hot summer months.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="economy">
      <h2>4. Economic Contributions</h2>
      <p>Though not a major commercial crop, Makopa is sold in local markets and provides supplemental income for small farmers. Some communities also cultivate it for specialty fruit markets and backyard farming businesses.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="sustainability">
      <h2>5. Sustainability and Conservation</h2>
      <p>Wax Apples are resilient plants that require minimal maintenance. They are commonly grown organically in backyards or small orchards, helping promote biodiversity and encouraging traditional farming practices among local farmers.</p>
