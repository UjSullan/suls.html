      <h2>1. Exploring the Internal Profile of Marang</h2>
      <p>Marang is a tropical fruit native to Mindanao in the southern Philippines. It has a spiny green exterior similar to jackfruit and durian but offers a much milder aroma and sweeter taste. Its creamy white pulp is soft and luscious, often compared to a mix of banana, custard, and vanilla.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="benefits">
      <h2>2. Dietetary Benefits and Nutritional Values</h2>
      <p>Marang is a good source of carbohydrates, fiber, and vitamins such as Vitamin C and B-complex. Its antioxidant content supports immune health and reduces oxidative stress. It also contains potassium and magnesium, which are essential for heart and muscle function.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="culture">
      <h2>3. Cultural Significance</h2>
      <p>In Mindanaoan culture, marang is a seasonal treat commonly shared among families during harvest. It symbolizes abundance and generosity and is often featured in local fairs and "fiestas." Locals regard it as a prized fruit because of its limited shelf life and unique flavor.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="economy">
      <h2>4. Economic Contributions</h2>
      <p>Marang farming provides additional income for small-scale farmers in Mindanao. Though not as commercially widespread as durian or jackfruit, it finds a niche market in local fruit stalls, road-side vendors, and small businesses selling fresh or processed fruit snacks.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="sustainability">
      <h2>5. Sustainability and Conservation</h2>
      <p>Marang trees are often grown organically in backyard farms, supporting biodiversity and low-impact farming. Encouraging its cultivation helps protect native fruit varieties and promotes food security through regional agriculture practices that are both traditional and sustainable.</p>
