      <h2>1. Exploring the Internal Profile of Blood Orange</h2>
      <p>Blood orange (Citrus sinensis) is a variety of orange with a deep red to purple flesh inside. It has a unique, tangy flavor, which is sweeter and less acidic than regular oranges. The red hue of its flesh comes from anthocyanins, a group of antioxidants.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="benefits">
      <h2>2. Dietary Benefits and Nutritional Values</h2>
      <p>Blood oranges are rich in vitamin C, fiber, and antioxidants. They are particularly high in anthocyanins, which have been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties. These fruits are excellent for boosting the immune system, improving skin health, and protecting against oxidative stress.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="culture">
      <h2>3. Cultural Significance</h2>
      <p>Blood oranges are often used in Filipino cuisine, both in savory dishes and desserts. The fruit is prized for its vibrant color and distinct taste, making it a favorite for juices, jams, and refreshing drinks. Its cultivation in certain regions also holds cultural significance as it represents tropical abundance.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="economy">
      <h2>4. Economic Contributions</h2>
      <p>Blood oranges contribute to the agricultural economy, especially in regions where citrus farming is common. They are grown for local consumption and are also exported, providing income for farmers and supporting the agricultural trade industry.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="sustainability">
      <h2>5. Sustainability and Conservation</h2>
      <p>The cultivation of blood oranges, like other citrus fruits, requires careful management of water resources and pest control. Organic farming methods are being encouraged to promote sustainability, with a focus on reducing the use of harmful pesticides and preserving soil health.</p>
