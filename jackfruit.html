      <h2>1. Exploring the Internal Profile of Jackfruit</h2>
      <p>Jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus) is the largest tree-borne fruit in the world, native to South and Southeast Asia, including the Philippines. It has a rough green skin and sweet, fragrant yellow flesh. The taste is often described as a blend of mango, banana, and pineapple, making it a popular tropical delicacy.</p>

    <section id="benefits">
      <h2>2. Dietary Benefits and Nutritional Values</h2>
      <p>Jackfruit is a rich source of vitamin C, potassium, fiber, and antioxidants. It helps strengthen the immune system, improve digestion, and support heart health. Jackfruit is also recognized as a good plant-based meat substitute because of its texture and nutritional benefits.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="culture">
      <h2>3. Cultural Significance</h2>
      <p>In the Philippines, jackfruit, locally known as "langka," plays a major role in traditional desserts like halo-halo, ginataang langka, and turon. It symbolizes abundance and prosperity and is often grown in backyard gardens for both food and family heritage preservation.</p>

    <section id="economy">
      <h2>4. Economic Contributions</h2>
      <p>Jackfruit farming contributes significantly to the agricultural sector. It is sold fresh in markets or processed into jams, candies, chips, and canned goods. With the rise of vegan and vegetarian diets globally, jackfruit exports as a meat alternative are also increasing, opening new economic opportunities for Filipino farmers.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="sustainability">
      <h2>5. Sustainability and Conservation</h2>
      <p>Jackfruit trees are hardy and resilient, requiring little maintenance and thriving in tropical climates. Promoting jackfruit cultivation not only ensures food security but also supports sustainable agriculture practices that benefit rural communities and preserve local biodiversity.</p>
